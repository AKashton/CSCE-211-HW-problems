PROBLEM 1:
compile and run the program, will allow for all operators asked for to work. Below is the comment section to explain why 
p3 = 2 + p3 did not work. can also be found in the source file Main.cpp on line 56. 

//p3 = 2 + p3 did not work because the overloaded operator+ method only takes in arguments where the left side of the operator is a object and the right side is
//a integer or where the left side and right side are both objects.
//in the case of 2 + p3, the left side is an integer, so there was no method to take this into account.

PROBLEM 2:
compile and run the program. You could put different zipcodes or barcode in the object parameters for zipcode and barcode
in main.cpp, but the current placeholders are from the example in the homework.

PROBLEM 3:
compile and run the program. You could change the order of the array on your own to mix up the movies
more, but the resulting output will be the same.

PROBLEM 4: 
Compile and run the program. 

PROBLEM 5:
compile and run the program, as long as the maze generator creates a solvable maze, the output will be
the solution. can run multiple times!
