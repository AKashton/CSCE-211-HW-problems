This file contains intstructions on how to run each program for assignment 1. I will list the problems in numerical order.

PROBLEM 1:
To run this program, you must have the .cpp file and the enrollments.txt in the same folder.
You must also run the program in a linux environment to effectictively use I/O redirection.

step 1: compile .cpp within Unix environment (g++ curry_problem_1.cpp).
step 2: run program with I/O redirection (./a.out < enrollments.txt).

The program should run and demonstrate all 9 digits and their counts. 

PROBLEM 2:
This program should run after compilation (if using the linux environment: g++ <PROGRAM_NAME.cpp>).
 
The program does take input from the user. it will first prompt you to enter a number for your wager, the money you 
have will be displayed in the program, the program will keep prompting you until you enter a valid number between 
1 and your current money avaliable.

You will then need to guess a number between 1-6 for guessing the rolls of the 3 dice, if you don't enter a valid
number, the program will prompt you again until it is valid. 

Finally, the program will ask you to roll the dice, you must enter d or D to get the roll started.

After the program has rolled the dice and calculated your payout, you can choose to play again by pressing 'y' or
end the program by pressing 'n'.

PROBLEM 3:
explanation is in the PDF document. 


PROBLEM 4:
The progam is run like normal. You must input a value between 1-99, which will give you your change back and 
how many coins were used. There is two test cases that were added to demonstrate the functionality of the
function.
